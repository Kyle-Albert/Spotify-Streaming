# bios-611-project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze athletics performances, for men and woman, in the 1500m, 5000m, and 10000m to examine the progression and improvement of the world records, but also to view the improvements of significant athletes in their rise to the top. Beyond examing performances from a time centric perspective, the competitve aspect of athletics is equally, if not more important. The pinnacle of the competiton is the olympics, with the world championships being secondary but almost as prestigous. Further eximing performances at these global championships to see which atheletes and countries have had the greatest success.

### Potential other project
It recently has come to my attention that I can request my extended listening history from spotify and get access to my entire history of music listening on the platform. Analyzing this data to see trends of when I listen to the most music (time of year or time of day), what songs and artists have I listened to the most, etc, would be incredibly intersting to me. As an avid music fan, this has been a dream project of mine to complete.
