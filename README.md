# bios-611-project

## Overview
The goal of this to project is to examine my extended streaming history from Spotify to look at trends such as which artists or individual songs have I listened to the most, which years was I listening to the most music, what months, etc. This dataset alongside with information pulled from each track from Spotify's web API such as valence, used as a measure of happiness, energy,dancibility, etc. can provide further insight on some interesting trends, like is there any patterns or correlations between the type of music I listen to and the time of day, or day of the week, and can these trends be used to predict the music I will listen to? Music has played an incredibly important and intimate role in my life, and performing these analyses are not just useful from potentially a behavior prediction of the user view point, but also from a personal view point.
